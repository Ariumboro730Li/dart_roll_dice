// The start and end of the gradient are specified as Alignment objects.
// The variables are mutable so that they can be changed at runtime.
// For example, the gradient can be made to flow from the bottom right
// to the top left by setting 'startAlignment' to Alignment.bottomRight
// and 'endAlignment' to Alignment.topLeft.
// !! var startAlignment = Alignment.topLeft;

// 'startAlignment' and 'endAlignment' are not intended to be changed.
// Using 'const' here has the added benefit of being able to detect if
// the values of 'startAlignment' and 'endAlignment' are accidentally
// changed, since Dart will throw a compile-time error if a 'const'
// variable is reassigned.
